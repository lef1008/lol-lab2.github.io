title: The Language of Learning (LOL) Lab
---

Welcome to the LOL Lab ðŸ¤£! We are a research lab in the University of Minnesota's educational psychology department. Since language influences EVERYTHING, our interests span from understanding how people visualize texts, to identifying the linguistic features of fake news spread across Twitter, to even the dynamics of semantics during conversation. However, more generally, we research the processes and factors that contribute to successful discourse comprehension and applying our work to improve existing educational technologies (or maybe we'll make our own soon ðŸ˜‰)!

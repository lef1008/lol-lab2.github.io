I am an Assistant Professor in the Psychology Department at the University of New Hampshire. The overarching aim of my research is to better understand the cognitive processes involved in language comprehension, writing, knowledge acquisition, and conceptual change, and to apply that understanding to educational practice by developing and testing educational technologies. Much of my work involves the development and use of natural language processing tools to provide a more nuanced understanding of the cognitive processes that are involved in text-based learning and communication. I then apply this research to educational technologies through the development of assessments and feedback that tap into the on-line cognitive and affective processes of individual system users.
